Hi visitors, my name is Srikar Paida. I'm an international graduate student at University of Maryland, College Park pursuing M.Eng. Cybersecurity, a domain I've been in love with since a long time. I enjoy learning concepts related to reverse engineering and offensive security and like doing CTFs sometimes.

I previously worked as a software engineer in India, at Integral Ad Science. In my free time, I like to read books (sometimes) or web comics, but most of the time, I'm just asleep.

I'm always willing to learning new things, solving puzzles and having fun with anything I can learn from.

You can contact me via email at spaida@terpmail.umd.edu, and do not hesitate to connect with me on [LinkedIn here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/srikarpaida/)!
I'm happy to help with anything I'm capable of and am open to take inputs and suggestions regarding anything.

Also, feel free explore my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/thesrikarpaida)!
