Hi visitors, my name is Srikar Paida. I'm an international graduate student at University of Maryland, College Park pursuing M.Eng. Cybersecurity, which I've been in love with since a long time.
I previously worked as a software engineer in India, at Integral Ad Science. In my free time, I like to read books (barely) or web comics, but most of the time, I'm just asleep.
I'm always open to learning new things, solving puzzles and having fun with anything I can learn from.
